Dan Lyons, laid off from his job as a satirist, joins a hot tech startup in Boston -- Hubspot.  He doesn't like it.  He finds much of it ridiculous.  Most of his tone is ridiculing.  It's entertainment.  A bit crude at times.  Mixed with his entertaining view, some of it seems legitimately painful.  There was apparently evidence at Hubspot of bad leadership, manipulation, and ill treatment of people.
