Here is a "new and shiney" presentation for running Django on Jython.  It's based on my experiences with the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/jython/DjangoOnJython">DjangoJython tutorial</a>.

As is discussed in the slide deck, and hence the subtitle of the presentation, much could be helped by more careful reading of documentation.  Well, moments ago, I decided that I hadn't checked out django-jython 1.1.  Well.... turns out many more problems could have been helped by using this later version.  Sweet!
