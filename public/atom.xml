    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a> makes use of the wonderful <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a> templates.  These templates, in order to be performant, must be precompiled.  Based on the Ember docs, it&#8217;s not abundantly clear how this is to happen.  Here&#8217;s a solution that works well.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/x5HT4FN.jpg" alt="Ember and Handlebars" /></p>

<h2>Grunt</h2>

<p>We&#8217;d love for this precompilation to happen previous to the running of your app.  Again, this is in hopes of increased performance.  <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> is a great little Nodejs-based tool for build-level tasks.</p>

<h2>Emblem</h2>

<p>Grunt comes with a variety of plugins.  We&#8217;re going to use one called <a href="https://github.com/wordofchristian/grunt-emblem/">grunt-emblem</a>.  <a href="http://emblemjs.com/">Emblem</a> is a fantastic templating syntax layered on top of Handlebars (still a dependency).  Its syntax looks very similar to Haml or Ruby Slim or Jade.  It may well be the most flexible of all of them, and it simplifies some Ember helper syntax very nicely.</p>

<h2>Versions Matching</h2>

<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/match-ember-handlebars-version/">matching Ember dependency version can be a pain</a>.  With precompilation, you have one more dependency to match.  Now not only do you care about the version of Handlebars that Ember uses at runtime, but you care about the version of Handlebars that is used to precompile your templates.  If the precompile Handlebars version doesn&#8217;t match the runtime Handlebars version, your app will die at runtime.  <code>grunt-emblem</code> helps immensely with this.</p>

<h2>grunt-emblem</h2>

<p>I haven&#8217;t found another Handlebars precompile plugin that helps as much as <code>grunt-emblem</code>.  It solves the precompile version problem by letting you utilize the actual runtime Handlebars as the precompile Handlebars script.</p>

<p>It is also nice in that it puts the precompiled templates into the collection that Ember expects to find templates in, namely <code>Ember.TEMPLATES</code>.  As you can find on the <a href="https://github.com/wordofchristian/grunt-emblem/"><code>grunt-emblem</code> Github page</a>, your grunt config will look something like the following:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This particular config has a couple other niceties.  Let me enumerate the awesome:</p>

<ul>
<li>Line 6 - Not only can we precompile the templates, but we&#8217;ll precompile on the fly, whenever <code>.emblem</code> files are change in the specified directories.</li>
<li>Line 8 and 14 - We&#8217;re precompiling <code>.emblem</code> templates, but this plugin can do regular Handlebars syntax as well</li>
<li>Line 16 - <code>root</code> is the substring that will be stripped out of your template name.  For instance, you don&#8217;t want your template to be called <code>app/views/templates/home</code>.  Your home route in Ember will want your template called <code>home</code>.  <code>root</code> to the rescue &#8211; bam!</li>
<li>Line 17 - These <code>dependencies</code> are the libraries that you use at runtime and that Handlebars needs at compile time.  As I said, this plugin simply rocks because of the ability to specify your own Handlebars script.</li>
<li>Line 23 - Remember how you used to have a whole list of npm tasks registered.  This little beaut will load all <code>grunt-*</code> dependencies.</li>
<li>Line 25 - <code>regarde</code> is a cool name, but I understand what <code>watch</code> means a bit better. Rename it.</li>
</ul>


<p>This setup requires the following dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">npm</span> <span class="nx">install</span> <span class="nx">matchdep</span> <span class="nx">grunt</span> <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">regarde</span> <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">contrib</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">livereload</span> <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">emblem</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nx">save</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">dev</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So now, seriously, go write some Emblem templates.  So fun, so precompiled.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Match Ember and Handlebars Versions]]></title>
    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/match-ember-handlebars-version/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-21T07:38:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/match-ember-handlebars-version</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a> is very specific about what version of <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a> it requires.  This is probably good, but it&#8217;s also a pain to work with as different versions of the two libraries are released independently.  There are a few good tools to help us out.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/x5HT4FN.jpg" alt="Ember and Handlebars" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Released Independently</h2>

<p>In a prime example, recently there was a new version of Handlebars released: <code>1.0.0-rc.4</code>.  Ember happens to be on version <code>1.0.0-rc.3</code>.  That version has a hard dependency on Handlebars <code>1.0.0-rc.3</code>.  In other words, the latest Ember code relies on an older version of Handlebars.</p>

<h2>Bower</h2>

<p>If you include these 3rd party libraries in your source code under a <code>lib</code> directory or something of that nature, you <em>always</em> have plenty of work to do.  Naturally, you just copy in the exact versions of the scripts that are needed.</p>

<p>Hopefully you&#8217;re trying to make use of a mostly awesome tool, <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a>.  It helps you manage these 3rd party libraries in a way similar to npm.  You provide a descriptor of your project&#8217;s dependencies, <code>component.json</code>.  And you install things similarly via the <code>bower</code> cli.</p>

<h2>Specify a Bower Version</h2>

<p>If I run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>bower install handlebars --save</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It saves a dependency in my <code>components.json</code> for Handlebars for the latest version it could find.  This won&#8217;t do for us.  We need to specify the versions.</p>

<p>Our strategy will be: take the latest version of Ember and then specifically match the Handlbars version.  Finally, we should type:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>bower install ember --save
</span><span class='line'>bower install handlebars#1.0.0-rc.3</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As of this writing, that is the version of handlebars that is required.  Bower will recognize any semver git tag name or branch name after the hash <code>#</code> sign.</p>

<p>I like our version strategy for a project that is under active development in that it keeps us on the latest Ember.  But, if you&#8217;re on a project that&#8217;s been built to an Ember version and not deployed for a long time, you may want to make a very specific dependency out of Ember as well, so the two are guaranteed in sync for future deploys.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/utahjs-conf-2013-review/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-20T06:59:00-06:00</updated>

<h2>The Schedule</h2>

<p>The conference covered a single day.  Keynote in the morning by Tom Dale, co-creator of Emberjs.  3 tracks thereafter with 5 talks each.  There was a specialized track, all focused on Angular, which was nice for anyone that wanted to focus on that framework.  There was less Node focus overall compared to last year, which was disappointing.  There were 3 talks focused on testing.  We need more good testing talks.</p>

<p>My impression on the talks overall was that they were well done and that the speakers were generally engaging.  The topics focused a little much on browser-side MV* frameworks, but I guess that&#8217;s hot right now.  Every talk I went to was meant for beginners at a very introductory level.  That was disappointing.  Of the topics presented, I found myself surprisingly most interested in Emberjs.  I have been tinkering with it since then and need to build something with it.</p>

<h2>The Food</h2>

<p>There was a plentitude of simple carbohydrates ready to serve to all learners at all times.  That was awesome.  Pastries appeared for breakfast, un-advertised.  They didn&#8217;t do a boxed lunch this year.  Some didn&#8217;t cry.  I almost did.  But I was pointed to a great gryo at a nearby Greek eatery instead.  Apparently the host venue, the Salt Lake City Public Library, didn&#8217;t approve of serving food.  This, I don&#8217;t understand, given that there was plenty of food floating around.  Apparenly pastries are ok, and sandwiches are not.</p>

<h2>The People</h2>

<p>Always a fun flavor to a conference, the attendees were great to mingle with.  The JavaScript community is a fun group to be with.  In Utah, we&#8217;re a fairly small, tight group.  It was fun to have Tom Dale show up.  It was even said by some that the Ember folks were &#8220;actually nice&#8221; as opposed to what was thought to be observed by some on Twitter.  Haha.  I smiled quite a bit when I heard that.</p>

<h2>The Afterparty</h2>

<p>The party was put on by O.C. Tanner and Domo.  O.C. Tanner is my current home base.  We were in charge of prepping the space.  It was like a classic text adventure trying to guide party-comers through the labyrinth of the O.C. Tanner building to the eventual pot of gold that was the party.</p>

<p>The food never stopped coming, even after my stomach had taken on its full capacity.  Marvelous Catering (gotta love that name) provided a delicious &#8220;luau pork dinner&#8221;.  I heard &#8220;luau&#8221; and assumed pineapple, of which there was none, which disappointed me just a little.  The owner of Fongo Bongo, a local game shop supplied a great collection of board and card games.  We had a couple Xboxen humming whilst TVs blasted fighting games to which I knew no combos.  We had a great time.</p>

<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m glad that this event has shown some perpetuity.  I hope it continues next year.  I think they have a good formula.  The price, the locale, the speaker lineup, and the associated activities make for a good one-day experience each Spring.  I would focus on improving one bit next year: the website.  It was the least well-done part of the conference.  I find that extremely ironic given the target market for the event.</p>

<p>So next Spring, come to Utah and attend the JsConf.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Test setTimeout with Jasmine]]></title>
    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/test-settimeout-with-jasmine/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-15T07:08:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/test-settimeout-with-jasmine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code that utilizes <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> becomes asynchronous.  Jasmine has some nice helpers to make your test synchronous again.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ks3wt01.jpg" alt="Jasmine" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Code Using setTimeout</h2>

<p>Any Javascript code that wants to delay certain actions or give intervals between actions will use <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> respectively.  There are also libraries that create some niceties for working in these situations, notably <a href="http://underscorejs.org">underscore</a>&#8217;s <code>_.throttle</code> and <code>_.debounce</code> functions.  Underneath all of these higher-level functions, they&#8217;re using the native <code>setTimeout</code> construct, so the same strategies will apply.  In your source, you end up with something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="kc">on</span> <span class="s">&#39;keyup&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;.autocomplete-field&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">debounce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">autocomplete</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code binds a keyup event listener on a contrived <code>.autocomplete-field</code>.  Of course, we don&#8217;t want to do an expensive <code>autocomplete</code> lookup on every keypress.  So, we&#8217;ll slow it down a bit with <code>_.debounce</code>.</p>

<h2>Testing Asynchronous Code in Jasmine</h2>

<p>Now we go to test it in Jasmine (failing):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">describe</span> <span class="s">&#39;Autocomplete Field&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">it</span> <span class="s">&#39;calls autocomplete when typing&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nv">called = </span><span class="kc">false</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nv">autocomplete = </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nv">called = </span><span class="kc">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nv">keyup = </span><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;keyup&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;.autocomplete-field&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">trigger</span> <span class="nx">keyup</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">called</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">should</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">be</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kc">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this test, or <code>autocomplete</code> spy will never be called, thus <code>called</code> will never be true.  There are a few ways to fix this.</p>

<h2>Mocking the Jasmine Clock</h2>

<p>One way to fix the test is to remove <code>_.debounce</code> from our source code.  That would make the test pass.  The other is to setup our Jasmine to handle the <code>setTimeout</code> used in <code>_.debounce</code>.  Let&#8217;s do the latter, and raise our fists to the sky in triumph over our testing foe (winning):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>

<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">describe</span> <span class="s">&#39;Autocomplete Field&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">beforeEach</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">jasmine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Clock</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">useMock</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">it</span> <span class="s">&#39;calls autocomplete when typing&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nv">called = </span><span class="kc">false</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nv">autocomplete = </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nv">called = </span><span class="kc">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nv">keyup = </span><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;keyup&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;.autocomplete-field&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">trigger</span> <span class="nx">keyup</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">jasmine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Clock</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">tick</span> <span class="mi">501</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">called</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">should</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">be</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kc">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The needed code is simple to add.  Use <code>jasmine.Clock.useMock()</code> to setup the fake ticker.  Then call <code>tick()</code> on it whenever you want your test to simulate time massage.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that this does not slow down your tests.  You could set the clock tick to be 50100000 or some crazy number, and it will still execute as fast as your single JavaScript thread will let you.</p>

<p>Boom.  Another testing hurdle cleared.  Sometimes it&#8217;s harder to write the test than the code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LiveReload is a wonderful tool/strategy for being able to develop websites more quickly.  You can make a change and see it immediately shown in the browser without requiring you to manually refresh.  To do this in NodeJs with Express, you&#8217;ll need just a few packages.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4773D.jpg" alt="grunt" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>LiveReload Express</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re doing a website on Nodejs these days, you&#8217;re probably using Express.  Express uses the Connect library for its middleware scheme.  Just grab one more middleware to handle the LiveReload.  It will add a little snippet of JavaScript to each of the html responses that is requested through this middleware.  First, install:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install connect-livereload --save-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, import:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">configure</span> <span class="s">&#39;development&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;connect-livereload&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="mi">35729</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that we only want to import and use the middleware when in development.  This matches the fact that we are only declaring this package as in <code>devDependencies</code>.</p>

<h2>LiveReload Grunt</h2>

<p>Now you need to something to start a livereload server, watch files for changes, and broadcast their availability.  The rest of this will be done via Grunt.</p>

<p>First, install:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install grunt-cli -g
</span><span class='line'>npm install grunt grunt-regarde grunt-contrib-livereload --save-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><code>grunt-cli</code> will allow you to run the <code>grunt</code> command in the terminal.  Global puts the bin in your path.</li>
<li><code>grunt-regarde</code> is a file watcher.  It senses changes to the filesystem.</li>
<li><code>grunt-contrib-reload</code> will handle the pushing of new code to the browser.</li>
</ul>


<p>Next setup the <code>Gruntfile.coffee</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nv">module.exports = </span><span class="nf">(grunt) -&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">initConfig</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">regarde:</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nv">style:</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nv">files: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;app/static/css/*.css&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nv">tasks: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;livereload&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">loadNpmTasks</span> <span class="s">&#39;grunt-contrib-livereload&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">registerTask</span> <span class="s">&#39;be-lively&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="s">&#39;livereload-start&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;regarde&#39;</span> <span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now when you run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt be-lively</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A livereload server is going to be setup.  Then we watch for filesystem changes.  The only things we&#8217;re watching are css files in our app.  You could expand the <code>files</code> array to watch more if you wish.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>

<h2>LiveReload all the Things</h2>

<p>There are many ways to make this happen.  There are numerous Node libraries, Grunt plugins, and browser plugins.  Do what works for you.  Just make it happen fast and tend it well from the beginning to the end of your project.  Almost every solution I&#8217;ve found is somewhat high maintenance.  This one has proven to be the same.  What have you found to be your favorite LiveReload solution, and in what environment?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xip.io is a DNS wildcard domain that was initially created for use on Ruby projects.  But its application is desirable across platforms.  Recently, I wanted to use Xip.io on a NodeJs project.  It was easy to make happen.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PJTnZmM.jpg" alt="xip.io" /></p>

<h2>Update: Proxying is Built Into Pow</h2>

<p>After having a handful of problems with these home-grown proxies, my search eventually led me to know that Pow 0.4.0+ includes proxying as a built-in feature.  So, you don&#8217;t need your own <code>config.ru</code> any more.  Once you install pow, choose the port that your app will run on and at what pow address you want to access your app, and run one command in your terminal:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo 3000 &gt; ~/.pow/myapp</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you&#8217;ll access your app, running in the background on port 3000 via the web browser at <code>http://myapp.dev</code>.  Way better.  Skip the rest of this article.</p>

<h2>Install Pow and Powder</h2>

<p>Pow is a development server that uses Xip.io.  Powder is a cli that makes working with Pow even easier.  To start, make sure that <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> is setup with <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> in your environment.  Then install Pow.  They have a short little install script you can run, as <a href="http://pow.cx/">referenced on the Pow site</a>.</p>

<p>Then install Powder:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem install powder</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Proxy your NodeJs app</h2>

<p>Pow only knows how to handle Rack apps, so we have to create one to be loaded into Pow.  Since we&#8217;re writing the guts of our app on another platform &#8211; in this case, Node &#8211; we&#8217;ll just create a proxy Rack app.</p>

<p>I found a bit of <a href="https://github.com/linjunpop/node-with-pow">proxy app code</a>, which you should save in your project root as <code>config.ru</code>, and which I paste here:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The only change you might have to make is the port number for your app (line 13).  In this case, I&#8217;m using port 3000 for my NodeJs app.</p>

<h2>Link Your App</h2>

<p>Now all we have to do is link our app to Pow.  Powder helps us do this easily.  Go to your project root directory and type:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>powder link &lt;project_name&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now run your app with whatever command starts NodeJs.  It&#8217;s probably something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>node app.js</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you should be able to access your app via your web browser at <code>http://&lt;project_name&gt;.dev</code>.  One of the great things about Xip.io is that it makes running your local app <a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/run-pow-server-on-vm/">extremely easy from a local Virtual machine</a> as well.  To get the address of your app to use in your VM, type this from your native terminal:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>powder open --xip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And copy the resulting URL into your VM web browser.</p>

<p>Ah, the fusion of Node and Ruby is pretty sweet.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/yeoman-app-on-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-23T07:12:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/yeoman-app-on-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yeoman is great developer tool that will help you generate a project format that is easy to get up and running quickly.  Out of the box, Yeoman only generates static sites.  But, with a few small tweaks, you can get it running on an app server, Nodejs, and up on Heroku.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1Mc2kXh.jpg" alt="Yeoman" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>New Project With Yeoman</h2>

<p>To install Yeoman, run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install -g yo</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now navigate to your new project directory and generate the scaffolding by running:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>yo webapp</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are other generators, specifically for angularjs or a handful of other frameworks.  To see more options, run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>yo --help</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Add Node for Heroku</h2>

<p>Since Yeoman creates a static site, it should be read to serve out of any old web server.  But Heroku specifically wants an app server.  Node is one of the options, and it&#8217;s a great option for a lightweight app server.</p>

<p>To get the node dependencies you need, create a <code>package.json</code> via:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm init</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then pull down the dependencies you&#8217;ll need:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install gzippo express coffee-script --save</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now create your app server, <code>web.coffee</code>.  It&#8217;s about as light as they come:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nv">gzippo = </span><span class="nx">require</span> <span class="s">&#39;gzippo&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">express = </span><span class="nx">require</span> <span class="s">&#39;express&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">app = </span><span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span> <span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">logger</span> <span class="s">&#39;dev&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span> <span class="nx">gzippo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">staticGzip</span> <span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nx">__dirname</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">/dist&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">listen</span> <span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">PORT</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="mi">5000</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s going to be serving the static resources that you build w/ Yeoman/Grunt that end up in the <code>dist</code> directory.  In order for code to get to Heroku, it needs to be commited to your git repo.  Thus, you need to remove the &#8220;dist&#8221; line from your <code>.gitignore</code> file, and don&#8217;t forget to add and commit the files to git as you build them.  You may also have to add more tasks to the <code>Gruntfile.js</code> to copy over any other assets to <code>dist</code> that your app needs to run.</p>

<p>Finally create a <code>Procfile</code> file for Heroku in the root of your project that points to the <code>web.coffee</code> server:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>web: coffee web.coffee</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now it&#8217;s time to push to Heroku.  You should have the Heroku Toolbelt installed and create a heroku url by running:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>heroku create &lt;my_project&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To test your yeoman app as it will be run in production, first build it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt build</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then run the grunt server:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt server:dist</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or if you have foreman and want to run the app using your <code>Procfile</code>, run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>foreman start</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s time.  Commit your code, especially that <code>dist</code> directory, and&#8230; deploy!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git push heroku master</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are quite a few steps there.  What did we miss?  Or what needs more explanation?  Perhaps we just need a <code>yo heroku</code> target.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently attended the Mountain West Ruby Conference.  It was my first time going.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the conference.  I would recommend it.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ABNr5MC.jpg" alt="Mountain West Ruby Conf" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Peeps</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m new to the Ruby community.  I get to use it more in my current job than I ever have before.  Whenever entering a new community, it&#8217;s good to find some friends.  I was pleased to notice that everyone I encountered at the conference was very friendly and welcoming.</p>

<p>About the coolest thing about the community is one of the slogans: MINSWAN, which means &#8220;Matz is nice, so we are nice.&#8221;  How cool is that?  Matz is the Ruby creator.  Wait, who am I kidding.  You already know that.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with the blatant lack of trolling other communities.  This even with the live stream video cameras rolling (people can tend to do weird things when put on camera).</p>

<p>The conference attracted speakers and attendees from as far away as Australia.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

<p>I didn&#8217;t look too closely at the schedule previous to attending.  Once I got there, I was surprised at the caliber of those people and companies who were represented.  These were big names in the tech community, such as Matz, himself, Github, Heroku, and others.</p>

<p>The conference is single track, so that meant I got to see everyone speak.  I mostly like that but kind of hate that.  I believe it also meant fewer speaking slots, so everyone was pretty top notch.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the stage presence of most speakers.  A few were pretty droning, but in general everyone was very polished, had good slide decks, and shared engaging and useful content.</p>

<p>Devops was the stated subject matter of an entire day of the conference.  This was cool.  We can use that kind of focus on the subject.  But then it bled into the next days as well.  I want some pure code, pure Ruby&#8217;ness.  I got some of that, but not as much as I would like.  I paid my devops dues the first day.  I was ready to not hear any more of it on days 2 and 3.</p>

<h2>Venue</h2>

<p>It was in my back yard!  I loved the lack of a hotel requirement!  Apparently some visitors even camped in the wilderness, Nacho style.</p>

<p>The Salt Lake City Public Library is a great downtown location for a small conference.  In this case, with the conference being single track, the single largest room, the amphitheatre, was the only room required for all attendees.  It featured plenty of seating &#8211; at the cost of no leg room.</p>

<p>The wifi also held up better than it has for similar gatherings in this space.  It was announced that &#8220;the city and Xmission are working feverishly&#8221; to maintain connectivity several times over the 3 days.  It still didn&#8217;t stay up.  This is a common tech conf occurrence.</p>

<p>I was sorely disappointed with the lack of sugary confections meant to encourage the jollyness and attentiveness of the conference-goers.  At one point, it was necessary to slip out and find a good bakery downtown.  I was not disappointed.  I was happy to see at least the vendors&#8217; vinyl stickers come out on the last day.  We need more of that!</p>

<p>In all, it was a good use of my couple days.  It wasn&#8217;t too pricey, but then, I wasn&#8217;t paying.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Make Jsonp Requests with AngularJs]]></title>
    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/make-jsonp-requests-with-angularjs/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-20T07:08:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/make-jsonp-requests-with-angularjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a couple ways to make cross domain requests from a client browser.  One method is called Jsonp or Json with padding.  The AngularJs library makes this really simple.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wVBKD.png" alt="AngularJs Jsonp" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Web Server Support</h2>

<p>First of all, your Jsonp request will be worth nothing if the server you&#8217;re requesting data from does not support it.  Jsonp requests require explicit support on the server side.  This is because the data that&#8217;s returned is formatted differently.  The &#8216;p&#8217; in Jsonp stands for padding.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s kind of a weird name.  Maybe Jsonf would be more analogous to reality.  This is because the Json data that you seek is really wrapped in a Javascript function.  This function is then evaluated as a script, passing the data into a callback to be saved by your client program.</p>

<p>This essentially is a browser hack to get around the security constraint of browsers not being able to request non-script items from different domains.  But since we request Javascript this way all the time, we&#8217;ll just make our data look like Javascript.</p>

<h2>Angular Jsonp</h2>

<p>You&#8217;re probably already used to using the <code>$http</code> service.  It provides the normal <code>get</code>, <code>post</code> and other functions mapped to http methods.  It also provides the function that we&#8217;ll need: <code>jsonp</code>.</p>

<p>The client script also requires that we specify the callback to send data to.  AngularJs has its own callback pattern, so it would follow that it has a pattern to handle Jsonp callbacks.  It does.  The callback is always called <code>JSON_CALLBACK</code>.  What parameter that it&#8217;s assigned to in the query string depends on the design of the web service you&#8217;re calling.  Take a look at the documentation on what&#8217;s required there.</p>

<p>All that jibber jabber for this simple example of a script asking for <a href="http://colorwheelie.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> data:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">jsonp</span> <span class="s">&#39;http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/colorwheelie.tumblr.com/posts/photo?api_key=&lt;mykey&gt;&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">success</span> <span class="nf">(data) -&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nv">$scope.colorwheelies = </span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">posts</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">error</span> <span class="nf">(data) -&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;ERROR&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The interesting line is line one.  We call the <code>jsonp</code> function.  We assign our callback like this: <code>callback=JSON_CALLBACK</code>.  And in our success callback, we can consume our data variable like it was pure Json.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You enjoy your work more when you&#8217;re having fun, right?  I wouuld think that much would be obvious to us all.  And yet, we need reminded now and again what really makes us tick.  Whether our endeavor is serious or purely for entertainment;  Whether the cause means a lot to us or we are just trying to pay the bills;  We will do better and be happier in every case if we inject a whole lot of fun into our work.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YdZuWS2.jpg" alt="I love to laugh" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Serious</h2>

<p>Serious work still needs a bit of a lilt to really work well.  This is especially true in creative work.  How many of us can be creative on demand?  It just seems to turn off the juice.  The motivation to continue doing something will come from a certain enjoyment and mental reward.</p>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>

<p>Even if the work you do is meant for others to consume purely as entertainment, it can easily be less than entertaining for those working on it.  It has to be enjoyable for you too.  There are so many types and tastes of entertainment; find something that is personally appealing.  Your personal engagement will be much higher.</p>

<h2>A Cause</h2>

<p>Working on a cause for which you have great feeling is probably one of the easiest things to find great inner motivation in doing.  But you can even burn out there.  Most of our jobs are done day after day.  There is a nature of monotony even in the best work simply because of repetition.  What can help counteract the daily march of work?  A bit of fun and excitement!  It&#8217;ll mean you&#8217;re simply jazzed to do what you feel is worthy of your time and effort.</p>

<h2>Pay Bills</h2>

<p>In the end, many work simply to pay the bills that never cease to appear.  This is in itself and worthy reason for working hard.  It is essential.  However, just the focus on and stress over bill payment is probably enough to poison your joy for work.  Two things will help.  Live well within your means so the bills don&#8217;t loom so large.  And hone your skills and do so well that you find the joy of work.</p>

<p>Simply put, work will consume a large portion of your life.  Would it not be better to smile and have fun during all that time?  Gratefully I&#8217;ve had both fantastic opportunities for work and the will to have fun.  Each of us have the opportunity to make it so.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/https-redirect-node-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-26T07:33:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/https-redirect-node-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When your app requires users to be using the <code>https</code> protocol to make requests and get responses, it&#8217;s helpful to have an automatic redirect so the user is always in the right place.  Here&#8217;s how to do that for a Node Express app on Heroku.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5rZ8H.png" alt="NodeJs Https Redirect" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Secure Express Requests</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://expressjs.com">Express</a> request object has a bunch of great information.  One of its attributes is <code>secure</code>.  It&#8217;s a boolean.  Usually, <code>secure == true</code> will mean that you&#8217;re on <code>https</code>.  When that is not true, you&#8217;re ready for a redirect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for apps hosted on Heroku, <code>request.secure</code> will always be false.  The way that Heroku routing works, it will just never be set.</p>

<h2>Heroku Https Header</h2>

<p>Instead, Heroku forwards an http header that allows us to do the same &#8220;is secure&#8221; test.  On Heroku, <code>request.header('x-forwarded-proto')</code> will contain the actual protocol string (eg, &#8216;http&#8217; or &#8216;https&#8217;).</p>

<h2>Express Middleware SSL Redirect</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re using the Express framework on Node, then you have it easy.  There&#8217;s already a great middleware mechanism for you to send any or all requests through.  If you set your Express app (v3) up like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nv">app = </span><span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you can use the <code>app.use</code> functionality to specify a middleware.  Since I only have certificates and want the redirect to happen in the production environment, I will likewise wrap this middleware inside <code>app.configure</code> for prod (it inspects <code>NODE_ENV</code> for you).  This redirect will be pretty rudimentary, but it&#8217;s just that simple, so here it goes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">configure</span> <span class="s">&#39;production&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span> <span class="nx">forceSsl</span><span class="nf">(req, res, next) -&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">header</span> <span class="s">&#39;x-forwarded-proto&#39;</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s">&#39;https&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">redirect</span> <span class="s">&quot;https://</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">header</span> <span class="s">&#39;host&#39;</span><span class="si">}#{</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">next</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If it&#8217;s not <code>https</code> already, redirect the same url on <code>https</code>.  If it is, that&#8217;s what I want, and you can pass on through my middleware function.  Note that this middleware will protect <em>all</em> urls on the site with an <code>https</code> redirect.  Your middleware could be more selective.  You could even create this as a stacked middleware per route if you wanted.  We could even enhance our middleware to use inspect both the http header <em>and</em> the <code>secure</code> flag.</p>

<p>Heroku threw us a for a minor, unexpected loop, but it was nothing that we couldn&#8217;t easily code for.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By default, Sinatra knows how to serve up a rendered html page.  With a slight tweak, we can make it spit out Json too!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZyCgi56.jpg" alt="JSON on Sinatra" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Data Format of the Web</h2>

<p>Json is my favorite data format for web applications.  Really, who wouldn&#8217;t want their webservice to expose Json?  It&#8217;s mucho useful.</p>

<p>First, add a line to the <code>Gemfile</code> that makes a Json helper method available to Sinatra:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sinatra-contrib&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, all you need to do is query the data that you want to return and actually return it, as in:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sinatra/json&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/my-models&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">json</span> <span class="no">MyModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>json</code> helper will then serialize your objects into Json, much to the delight of your clients!</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/pass-values-from-page-to-angular/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-22T07:10:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/pass-values-from-page-to-angular</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are simple mechanisms for passing data from your web page to AngularJs.  One directive is called <code>ngInit</code>.  You may well need it.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wVBKD.png" alt="Angular data passing" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Use Cases</h2>

<p>The use cases don&#8217;t make a ton of sense without a concrete example.  There are several ways to implement even the most simple example.  If the solution doesn&#8217;t seem to fit the problem, try another way.</p>

<p>For our purposes, let&#8217;s say that we&#8217;re displaying a list of comments on the screen.</p>

<h4>Angular Requests Data</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to put data into scope for AngularJs to use if Angular is the one to request the data initially.  This often will look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/comments&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">success</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">(comments) -&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">$scope.comments = </span><span class="nx">comments</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then your template will automatically have the data in scope.  And the template (<a href="http://slim-lang.org">Slim</a> syntax used below) can look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="no">Comments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ul</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">li</span> <span class="n">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">repeat</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;comment in comments&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">{{</span> <span class="n">comment</span> <span class="p">}}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now when we add a new comment via Ajax, we can push it right into the comment collection, and the page is updated by Angular with the appropriate data.  Or if we want to perform an operation on a pre-existing comment, it&#8217;s easy to do via an AJAX operation and display the result.</p>

<h4>Server Renders Data Initially</h4>

<p>Sometimes it&#8217;ll make sense for the server to render the data.  Often this kind of data will be the main content on the page.  When the client receives the page, we want the data display to be immediate.  We don&#8217;t want them to load a page with a spinner for the main content, then wait and watch it spin while the real content is requested secondarily.</p>

<p>If the server was to initially print the comments, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="no">Comments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ul</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">comments</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">comment</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">li</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">comment</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We still might want to do AJAX&#8217;y things with a comment, such as like it.  When I like it, I don&#8217;t want the browser to have to refresh, so I want to make Angular do this for me.</p>

<h2>ngInit Passes Angular Server Data</h2>

<p>Angular provides a nice directive, <code>ngInit</code> for passing Angular data.  It&#8217;s a mechanism by which you can bootstrap your scripts with the data they need to function.  A mixture of server rendering and client-side AJAX requests on the same data will probably mean that you&#8217;re going to use this directive.</p>

<p>From the <code>ngInit</code> docs:</p>

<blockquote><p> The ngInit directive specifies initialization tasks to be executed before the template enters execution mode during bootstrap.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our server/client mixture code might look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="no">Comments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ul</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">comments</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each_with_index</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">comment</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">li</span> <span class="n">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;commentLikeCount[i]=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">comment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">likeCount</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">comment</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">|</span> <span class="no">Likes</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="n">comment</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{{</span><span class="n">commentLikeCount</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">}}</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">click</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;like(commentLikeCount[i])&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s important to realize where data is coming from in this example.  The syntax <code>=</code> as in <code>= comment</code> and <code>#{}</code> as in <code>#{comment.likeCount}</code> are server-rendered bits.  As you know, the curlies and the ng attribute syntax is for Angular&#8217;s client side rendering.</p>

<p>So how has this mixture bought us anything?</p>

<ol>
<li>The server renders the comments initially.  This makes the display immediate when the browser loads the page.</li>
<li>We init the value of <code>commentLikeCount</code>, making it available for Angular to display once the client compiles the template.</li>
<li>Since Angular has a count of the likes, it can easily update it and redisplay without a page reload after calling <code>like()</code> to increment the count.</li>
</ol>


<p>Frankly, the mixture feels a little bit odd to me.  I&#8217;ve seen it work.  I know there are different ways to get this done.  I think there are probably better ways.  What has worked well for you in similar use cases?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finding an element in context means that I can select a node from the dom within a certain range &#8211; specifically either a node or any of its children nodes.  Is there an &#8220;Angular way&#8221; to do this?</p>

<h2>Angular&#8217;s Element() API</h2>

<p>Angular provides jqLite for doing basic CSS selections.  As far as I can tell, it does not give you the ability to specify a context node.  Sure, you can specify a more specific selector, but you can&#8217;t pass a context programmatically.  The best you could do would look something like:</p>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">angular</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.my-preknown-context .element-to-find&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If that&#8217;s sufficient for your use case, this would be the most &#8220;Angular way&#8221; to make an element selection.</p>

<h2>jQuery&#8217;s API</h2>

<p>If you need to make CSS selections within a given context, you&#8217;ll need to use jQuery.  jQuery&#8217;s selector will be used in place of jqLite if it is loaded previous to the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event firing.  In other words, import jQuery in the <code>head</code> tag.</p>

<p>With jQuery, you can do things like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.element-to-find&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.my-preknown-context&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But we could already do that with the above <code>angular.element</code> function.  If a constraint of our use case is that we don&#8217;t yet know the selector of the context, then we need to  use this same jQuery API to do what we couldn&#8217;t before.  For instance, if we want to find a child element of an element that was clicked, the inside of the click handler might look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.element-to-find&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">currentTarget</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We could also write it like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">currentTarget</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.element-to-find&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well, why not use <code>angular.element().find()</code>?  Because it is limited to querying children by tagName only.  Oh boy.  That&#8217;s not all that useful.  Interesting/weird constraint.  Oh well, maybe someday.</p>

<h2>jQuery, Meet Angular</h2>

<p>So, using full jQuery is probably not the most &#8220;Angular way&#8221;.  So, what&#8217;s the best you can do?  Use Angular to get the context reference.  In a click handler, use the <code>$event</code> service which references the event object:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.element-to-find&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">$event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">currentTarget</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In a controller, use the <code>$element</code> service which references the dom node the controller is attached to:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.element-to-find&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">$element</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This method uses jQuery to fill in for something it seems Angular can&#8217;t do yet.  And it uses Angular where possible, since it has access to these dom references already.</p>

<p>What do you think?  Is there a more &#8220;Angular way&#8221; to do this?</p>

    <updated>2013-02-20T16:39:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/serve-coffeescript-with-sinatra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sinatra is nice because it&#8217;s super lightweight.  This will allow you to make it do exactly what you want, nothing more.  This is the opposite of Ruby on Rail&#8217;s convention.  Likewise, it takes just a bit more configuration to make Sinatra serve CoffeeScript as compared to Rails.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ta27Zd4.jpg" alt="Sintra and CoffeeScripting" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Sinatra and CoffeeScript</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, there are no fantastic gems, at least that I could churn up in a few Google searches, that make serving CoffeeScript bone head easy.  I found a few, such as the Sinatra Assetpack.  It looked like serious overkill, and my Sinatra app is very small, so I wanted a quick and easy way to serve the static goods.</p>

<h4>CoffeeScript Gem</h4>

<p>Sinatra needs a Gem to compile the CoffeeScript.  Put this line in your <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem "coffee-script"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And run a:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ bundle install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Public Directory</h4>

<p>In my app, <code>web.rb</code> is the main controller file.  Next to that file, I have a directory structure like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>public/
</span><span class='line'>  js/
</span><span class='line'>  coffee/
</span><span class='line'>web.rb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By default, Sinatra will serve static assets out of this <code>public</code> directory.</p>

<h4>CoffeeScript Handler</h4>

<p>I created the <code>coffee</code> directory separate from the <code>js</code> directory so that I could write this little handler in <code>web.rb</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/coffee/*.js&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">filename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:splat</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">first</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">coffee</span> <span class="s2">&quot;../public/coffee/</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_sym</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This handler will pick up requests that match &#8220;/coffee/*.js&#8221;, find the associated <code>.coffee</code> file, compile it to JavaScript and serve it.  I kept the file extension as <code>.js</code> to help avoid handling any potential mime-type setting requirements.  Obviously, this handler is simple and won&#8217;t handle complicated cases.  But that is also a plus.</p>

<h4>CoffeeScript in Templates</h4>

<p>In my <a href="http://">Slim</a> template, if I wanted to get the compiled contents of the file named <code>myscripts.coffee</code>, I would write a script tag like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">script</span> <span class="n">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/coffee/myscripts.js&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<h2>Quick Sinatra Setup</h2>

<h4>Require Sinatra</h4>

<p>Sinatra is super easy to setup.  Create a <code>Gemfile</code> with the dependencies as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://rubygems.org&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sinatra&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;thin&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then create a default <code>web.rb</code> webserver with contents that look something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sinatra&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then if you run the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">ruby</span> <span class="n">web</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rb</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should get a startup message like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">==</span> <span class="no">Sinatra</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">taken</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stage</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="mi">4567</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">development</span> <span class="n">with</span> <span class="n">backup</span> <span class="n">from</span> <span class="no">Thin</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">Thin</span> <span class="n">web</span> <span class="n">server</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">codename</span> <span class="no">Knife</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">Maximum</span> <span class="n">connections</span> <span class="n">set</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="mi">1024</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">Listening</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">4567</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">CTRL</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">C</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">stop</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Go to <code>localhost:4567</code> in your browser to try out your server.</p>

<h4>Require Slim</h4>

<p>Returning a string is all well and good, but let&#8217;s include Slim to be able to create more sophisticated templates. Include your Slim dependency in your <code>Gemfile</code> with the line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;slim&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then from the Terminal, run:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">bundle</span> <span class="n">install</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Setup your Views</h4>

<p>Then create a directory next to your <code>web.rb</code> file called <code>views</code>.  Inside <code>views</code>, you can create your templates.  You can create a layout template aptly named <code>layout.slim</code>.  By default, your templates will extend from this layout.  Most simply, these files might look like this:</p>

<p>layout.slim:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haml'><span class='line'>doctype html
</span><span class='line'>html
</span><span class='line'>  head
</span><span class='line'>    title My Slim Templates App
</span><span class='line'>  body
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">yield</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And, index.slim:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haml'><span class='line'>h1 Loving Slim
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Serve a Slim File</h4>

<p>And now to adjust our <code>web.rb</code> file to serve the new <code>index.slim</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sinatra&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;slim&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">slim</span> <span class="ss">:index</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally restart your server, and you should see your new template shown in all it&#8217;s glory.  Pretty easy cheesy.</p>

<h2>Setup Slim on Rails</h2>

<p>Want something even easier?  Well, if you know <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> already, this will be a cinch.  The hardest part of getting Slim running on Rails is Rails itself.  Slim integration is even easier than on Sinatra.  Simply add this line to your Gemfile:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;slim-rails&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And then in order to activate the Slim handler, merely add the <code>.slim</code> extension onto the end of any of your template file names.  Your file names probably end in <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html"><code>.erb</code> by default</a>.  Change the ones that you want to convert to Slim templates to look like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">slim</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now the Rails are even slicker.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-19T07:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/jumpstartlab-ruby-training-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a> offers a <a href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/courses/">Ruby training</a>.  I recently attended.  I had a great experience and learned a lot in my first real introduction to Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  I would highly recommend the course.  Here are a few more details on my experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DniDljD.png" alt="Jumpstart Lab" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Format</h2>

<h4>Length</h4>

<p>Jumpstart sent a great instructor, <a href="https://twitter.com/franklinwebber">Franklin Webber</a>, to come lead us through the exercises.  The course was on site at our company.  It was 5 days in length.  Instruction went from 9am to 4pm daily, with a 1 hour break at lunch time.</p>

<h4>Breaks</h4>

<p>Exercises throughout the day were split up into 25 min time chunks with 5 min breaks following.  Some will recognize this usual time chunks for the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a>.  Frank, as the leader of the exercises, was more strict in his observance of the Pomodoro time slices than I&#8217;m used to seeing.  Many people I&#8217;ve worked with would work right through a short break, but we took breaks quite religiously.</p>

<h4>Content Split</h4>

<p>In our 5 day training, we spent about the first 3 days going over vanilla Ruby.  The next 2 days, we focused on the Ruby on Rails framework specifically.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<h4>TDD</h4>

<p>Probably about the coolest aspect of this training was its relying on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> to get stuff done.  Often training courses, especially those that introduce brand new languages and concepts, leave testing as a tack-on feature, meantioned in parting near the end of the course.  Thankfully, Jumpstart did a great job integrating this best practice into most of its instruction.</p>

<p>We used <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">Rspec</a> as a test runner.  We used <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> to help us go faster through our test iterations.  We discussed what to test, how to make our tests more readable, how to isolate tests using <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs">mocks</a>, and practiced doing lots of tests.</p>

<p>Only the Rails portion of the course was taught using error-driven development.  This actually worked quite well, as learning to use a framework requires learning how the pieces connect and trying not to test the framework.</p>

<h4>Instructor-Led</h4>

<p>Frank made the class successful.  He is super knowledgeable about the subject matter.  He is fun and funny.  He is great at introducing topics that built upon each other.  He is great at letting the students figure things out for themselves and jumping in at the right moment to help clear hurdles.  It was great to meet and work with Frank, and I hope to do so again.</p>

<h2>Bonuses</h2>

<h4>Hack Night</h4>

<p>We do a <a href="http://tannerhack.eventbrite.com/">hack night</a> every other week at work anyway.  Since Frank was here, he led the hack night.  We did a Codemash kata exercise where we created code to generate a <a href="https://github.com/jaketrent/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> board.  We split into teams and pair-programmed our different solutions.  Everyone came up with unique solutions, we compared them, and then iterated.  I had so much fun with the exercise, I put a frontend on the game and made it <a href="http://minemopper.herokuapp.com">playable</a>.</p>

<h4>Tutorial Content</h4>

<p>Jumpstart printed materials for us in a booklet.  The <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com">tutorials</a> are also available online.  Frank took a unique path through the content, and we talked through our specific approach.  As he worked, Frank also <a href="https://github.com/burtlo/training-021113">uploaded the code</a> from our instruction to Github.  I did the same for <a href="http://github.com/jaketrent/ruby-training">my code</a>.</p>

<h4>Recommendation</h4>

<p>I think that this training series was about the best I&#8217;ve attended.  I&#8217;m doing a lot more Ruby and Rails in my current job than I expected even a few weeks ago, so it was very timely and useful for me.  The content was good, but it was the instruction that made it top notch.  Thanks, Frank and Jumpstart, for the great experience!</p>

<p>By default, Rails will create a file at:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this file, there will be a default <code>yield</code> block similar to this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It has no name.  It&#8217;s just the default place for templates that use this layout file to put their content.</p>

<p>We can create new <code>yield</code> blocks.  We&#8217;ll have to give them a distinguishing name.  They look about the same.  If I wanted to create a new <code>yield</code> block where, for instance, alerts could be displayed if the child template had them, I could put this in my layout file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;%=</span> <span class="k">yield</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:alert</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I would just need something to go in it.</p>

<h2>Child Templates</h2>

<p>A child template that uses the <code>application.html.erb</code> layout file can just start blasting out markup that will go into the default <code>yield</code> block.  This will usually be the main content.  But in our example, there might be more focused content such as alerts that we want to display in a separate area.  Thus, our template could potentially look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;My main content&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Bacon ipsum…&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="n">content_for</span> <span class="ss">:alert</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-success&quot;&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    You created multiple yield blocks!</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Throw down a <code>content_for</code> block, matching the name of the <code>yield</code> block in your layout file, and you&#8217;re set.  Order does not matter.  Your specific <code>content_for</code> blocks can come before, after, or in the middle of your main content.  Easy as Ruby pie.</p>

    <link href="http://jaketrent.com/post/rename-files-in-asset-pipeline/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-06T07:06:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/rename-files-in-asset-pipeline</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails provides a powerful mechanism for preparing your site&#8217;s static assets for the web.  It&#8217;s called the asset pipeline.  True to Rails, it has sensible defaults.  Also true to form, it&#8217;s not immediately clear what&#8217;s required to change from the defaults.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HPJDXPB.jpg" alt="Asset Pipeline" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Multiple Compilers</h2>

<p>The asset pipeline has the ability to pass your static assets through multiple compilers.  Thus, they seem much less static than they might be.  The compilers used are determined by the file extension.  For instance, this file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>myscripts.js.coffee.erb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Will go through the Erb compiler first, then the Coffeescript compiler, then finally will output pure JavaScript.</p>

<p>Changing these files are no problem.  Want a new compiler?  Slap on a new file extension.  Don&#8217;t need one?  Remove it.</p>

<h2>Manifest File</h2>

<p>Manifest files are full of Sprocket directives.  Sprockets will use these files to combine and minify your css and js.  A manifest will look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>//= require vendor/jquery
</span><span class='line'>//= require vendor/angular.min
</span><span class='line'>//= require vendor/angular-cookies</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These directives identify what files will eventually be combined, replacing the contents of your manifest file in the final output.</p>

<p>If you change the name of scripts or stylesheets, you need to ensure that your manifest file is changed to match.  Otherwise, asset precompilation will fail.</p>

<p>By default the manifest filenames are these:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app/assets/javascripts/application.js
</span><span class='line'>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Changing Manifest Filenames</h2>

<p>Changing the manifest default filenames will require some tweaking.</p>

<p>For instance, if I change application.js to be split into two separate manifest files, <code>scripts-foot.js</code> and <code>scripts-head.js</code>, the next time I run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake assets:precompile</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It will succceed, and everything will look like it&#8217;s just fine.  But when I go to run the app, it will give my an error like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ActionView::Template::Error (scripts-head.js isn't precompiled):
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>2013-02-04T16:24:05+00:00 app[web.1]: app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:14:in `_app_views_layouts_application_html_erb__3761578772688930207_28706600'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you switch from the default manifest files or when you reference a static asset like a js or css directly from your view, you&#8217;ll need to mark it as explicitly requiring precompilation.</p>

<p>This is done in an environment file, such as <code>config/environments/production.rb</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># Precompile additional assets (application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS are already added)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assets</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">precompile</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="sx">%w( scripts-foot.js scripts-head.js )</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s that easy.  It&#8217;s too bad you have to wait until the app runs to discover this is a problem.  But now you&#8217;re ready.</p>

<p>Now if we could only customize the directory structure under <code>app/assets</code>.  I would much rather use the path <code>js/</code> instead of <code>javascripts/</code>.  Does anyone know how?</p>

    <id>http://jaketrent.com/post/run-pow-server-on-vm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s really pretty cool how easy <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a> makes running a Rails server.  <a href="https://github.com/rodreegez/powder">Powder</a> makes it even easier.  Here&#8217;s how to run your Rails server via Pow on a VM in order to test IE.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XdExdtS.jpg" alt="Pow Server" /></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Install Pow</h2>

<p>Get your Ruby environment otherwise setup for Rails dev. Then install <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a>.  It&#8217;s a nice little utility created by the folks at 37 Signals.  They have a short little install script you can run, as <a href="http://pow.cx/">referenced on the Pow site</a>.  Or, you can use a utility created to make it <em>even easier</em> &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/rodreegez/powder">powder</a>.</p>

<p>To install, you&#8217;ll need <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> installed, and run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ gem install powder</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then link your project to Pow via the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ cd &lt;my_proj_dir&gt;
</span><span class='line'>$ powder link</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Make sure Pow is running:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ powder up</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And access your Pow-powered site by going to your project&#8217;s address in your browser:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>http://&lt;my_project_dir&gt;.dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are other options in the <code>powder link</code> step.  For instance, if you want to access your site through an http address different than <code>&lt;my_proj_dir&gt;</code> you can specify that.</p>

<h2>Install your VM</h2>

<p>There are a few different VM options.  My favorite is <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>.  It does hurt a bit seeing the &#8220;Oracle&#8221; moniker on it, but I&#8217;ve found it to be as responsive as a VM can be and generally stable.</p>

<h2>Install Internet Explorer</h2>

<p>There really wasn&#8217;t another reason that you wanted a Windows VM was there?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had good success with  the project <a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">xdissent/ievms</a>.  To download the IE-ready images, the README invites us to run this script in our shell:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | bash</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It will download multiple parts of several Windows/IE VM images into <code>~/.ievms</code> and install them so they&#8217;re ready to roll with VirtualBox.  Run this way, images for Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, and 9 are all downloaded.  If you wanted to just download IE 9, you could run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="9" bash</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Either way, this download takes quite a while to complete, but the shell script that&#8217;s running it takes pretty good care of you, restarting on the last incomplete download part.</p>

<h2>Access Pow via VirtualBox</h2>

<p>Accessing Pow in the VM isn&#8217;t bad at all.  Pow makes use of <a href="http://xip.io">xip.io</a>, which provides a wildcard DNS entry used by Pow and thus your app.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_2.1.5">next step</a>, take note of your IP by running <code>ifconfig</code>.  Then from IE inside of VirtualBox, point your browser at:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>http://&lt;my_proj_dir&gt;.&lt;my_ip&gt;.xip.io</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And you should see your project running in the VM just as you do from your better, native OS.  Pow!</p>
